Regrets over coding until 4 a.m., irregularities in my bowel movements, or words that earned me a smile today are words that roll right off the tip of my fingers for a journal entry. Unfortunately, what's easy to write in my journal isn't incredibly useful to a stranger on the internet.<!-- end-preview -->

Publicizing my daily journal entries could be entertaining, especially if you share my strange fascination to discover what goes on behind the curtain of others' lives. But I hope I have more to offer than an impulsive read that leaves you with knowledge you'd _probably_ be better off without.

I want to create articles that are worth sharing and enjoyable to read. But do I have something worth sharing?

No, I don't. At least not an idea that hasn't already been shared. But, **what does anybody have that's worth sharing?**

There are more written words than there are stars in our galaxy[^1], and bloggers pollute it with more each day. <Tooltip text="- Mark Twain">There is no such thing as a new idea</Tooltip> and <Tooltip text="- Malcolm Muggeridge">all new news is old news happening to new people</Tooltip>.

Despite the bleak real estate on ideas, writers still write, musicians still compose, and tech entrepreneurs still try to create the next big social media platform that <Tooltip text="One day we might escape our alien overlord, Zuckerberg">no one will ever use</Tooltip>.

With writing, I may not introduce new ideas into the world or find profit[^2], and that's just fine. External benefits aren't my priority in writing publicly, the [internal benefits of writing are incredible](https://www.helpscout.com/blog/benefits-of-writing/). I benefit from writing publicly because my thoughts have to be ordered more clearly and presented in a more digestible format than the <Tooltip text="- Had amazing poop after 3 mile run">bullet points</Tooltip> I typically use in my journal.

Unfortunately for us, humans aren't always motivated to do things just because we know they're good for us.
 We must use methods that trick our animal brains into developing habits and cravings for the things we _should_ do. 
 I don't engage in writing just because it's good for me, I pursue writing because like coding or making music, it has the potential to immerse me into a state of **flow**.[^3]

Experiencing flow is better than sex. If you're an artist, you already know this. A night of improvising on piano puts me to sleep filled to the brim with contentment. Testing out a project I've coded leaves me basking in its _"I made this"_ energy.

<Figure image="https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/001/079/173/ed2.png" caption="Suspend disbelief in the originality of your ideas to enable basking." />

Unlike sex, video games, or social news feeds that mimic [flow-like characteristics](https://mobile.twitter.com/sarah_edo/status/1415486930955894786), the process of creation leaves you with something to show for all the time and energy you've invested into it. You've created something instead of just consuming.[^4]

The idea that we can do things that are both enjoyable and good for us is central to my life philosophy. It's what transformed my college transcript with 5 F's on it to above 3.0 by graduation. It's what has enabled me to achieve everything I have and enjoy in my life today.

I want to share the ideas that have helped me reach where I am. By no means do I have it all figured out. Life is a continuous learning process, and one of the best ways to learn is to teach.[^5] 

I write to teach. I write to learn. I write to experience the intrinsic joy of writing.

If I happen to write something useful for you, then all the better.

[^1]: In 2010 there were approximately [129,864,880](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2010/08/google-there-are-exactly-129-864-880-books-in-the-world/61024/) books in the world. Using the lowest estimated average words in a book, [20,000](https://www.bookeditingservices.co.uk/average-word-count-in-a-book.html), we get aprox. 2.5 trillion words against the [100 billion](https://www.space.com/25959-how-many-stars-are-in-the-milky-way.html#:~:text=In%20the%20end%2C%20it%20comes,sun%2C%20and%20averages%20them%20out.) stars in the Milky Way. And that's just books.

[^3]: The late Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi's book, Flow absolutely changed my life. However, it's a bit dated and more recent literature better communicates his findings. I highly recommend reading through [a summary](https://positivepsychology.com/mihaly-csikszentmihalyi-father-of-flow/).
[^4]: By my logic you could argue that sex is on par with artistic creation if children are the result. Terrifying.
